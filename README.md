# learning-motivation

**Implementation of the analyses described in Kuperwajs and Ma (2025).**

## Approach

This repository provides analysis code for studying learning and motivation in 4-in-a-row using Jupyter notebooks. The preprocessed data necessary to run the code is available at https://osf.io/5xp8q, and source code for computing Elo ratings is available at https://www.remi-coulom.fr/Bayesian-Elo.
